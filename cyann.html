        I am Cyann Williams, and I am indecisive. I felt that was important to
        say because I am interested in three fields within computer science.
        Software development, game development and cybersecurity are thoses three.
        I also want to start an ecomerce business by July 2023, I am already set up,
        I just have to start selling some of my products. I want to start traveling by
        the end of the year. I am the best person you will ever meet, haha.

        This video motivates because I was too comfortable being comfortatble.
        I started to realise where being comfortable has gotten me and my
        parents. How I watched them be comfortable making the same mistakes
        my whole childhood, it was literally instanity. <b>I didn't want to be insane
            anymore. So, I started to stand up for myself, beliefs and dreams.</b> So far,
        it has already done more for me than being comfortable. I am now in IC stars,
        literally following my dreams.

        I was just explaining to my friend that the best things in life don't come easy.
        You have to keep pushing, but also be kind to yourself.
